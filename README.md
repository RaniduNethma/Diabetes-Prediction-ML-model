# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 🩺

This project implements a **Diabetes Prediction System** using a **Random Forest Classifier** to determine whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical attributes.

The model is built for **educational and research purposes** using supervised machine learning techniques.
